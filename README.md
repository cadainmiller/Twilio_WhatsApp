# Twilio WhatsApp Web Application

This basic web application should allow anyone to send a WhatsApp message  

The front-end is made with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and JQuery. HTML5 and CSS3 for the UI design while the JavaScript/JQuery is used for server-client communication. The web app responsiveness is also taken care of by using plain old Vanilla JavaScript.

Getting started:
•	Go into the folder then shift + right click.
•	In the terminal run code "npm install".
•	In the terminal run code "npm start" to start the server.
•	In your browser, goto http://localhost:3000/
